    <p>My name is Mitchell de Kort , Junior web Developer at Becode.
    I've been following this education in Genk for 4 months, from September 2019 untill December 2019.
    During that time , i've learned the very basics using the terminal and Git. 
    We had exercises to learn HTML , CSS , SASS , Bootstrap and JavaScript.
    In the last month of the course we could choose what specialization we chose.
    For me , i went with VUE.js , so i could build UI Wireframes.
